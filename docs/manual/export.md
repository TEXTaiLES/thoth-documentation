</p>

A user can save the changes applied to a scene by selecting the export button on the top toolbar. This will save the changes to the scene json located within the appropriate directory.

The scene json can afterwards be fetched using the [ATON REST API](../api/rest.md)

In order to save changes successfuly, you must be logged in as an authenticated administrative user. You can do so by pressin the <img src="../assets/icons/user.png" alt=" " width="15" style="vertical-align:middle; margin-right:0px;"> User icon and logging in with your credentials. **For demo purposes**, the admin user defined by ATON has the following credentials:

Username| `ra`
:---|:---
**Password**| `ra2020`

*The user system will be expanded uppon deploying THOTH to a dedicated database.*
