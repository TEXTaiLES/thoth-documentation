# History

By using the Undo/Redo commands and the History panel, you can move to previous/next states in your scene.

Moves one step back in the undo queue. Press the undo button or use the keyboard shortcut Control + Z. 

<img src="/assets/icons/redo.png" alt="redo" width="20" style="vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;"> **Redo**

Moves one step forward. Press the redo button or use the keyboard shortcut Control + Y.

It's worth noting that history is stored seperately for each user in a collaborative scene. Undo/Redo commands from each user will affect only their actions and not those of other users.
