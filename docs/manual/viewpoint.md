THOTH allows you to view the source images from which the 3D object was reconstructed. 

To view a source image, click on one of the viewpoint spheres in the scene. This will open up a card containing information about the viewpoint (position, target, image). You can then view the image for higher-resolution viewing and downloading.

You can hide the viewpoint spheres from the Viewpoint tab in the settings menu.

*The displayed viewpoints are selected from the COLMAP metadata*

*For the time being, both the viewpoints and images are completely artificial for demo purposes and irrelevant to the COLMAP of the object.*
