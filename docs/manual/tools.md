## Select a tool
To select a tool, do one of the following: 
    
- Click a tool in the Tool panel.
    
- Press the tools's keyboard shortcut. The keyboard shortcut is displayed in its tool tip. More information on tooltips can be found under the [keybinds](keybinds.md) section.

Each tool also has additional adjustable options that can alter its usage, such as size and normal thresholds.

## Additive/Subtractive mode

Each tool has a default functionality to either add or remove faces from a selection (e.g, the brush adds faces to a selection). This functionallity is used when the tool is used with the left mouse button.

When a tool is used with the right mouse button, any faces that would be added to the selection would instead be removed.
