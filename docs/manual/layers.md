# Layers

## Layer Overview

Each layer can be thought of as a different annotation object, in other words a structured descriptor for a specific selection. Visually, it is represented by the selected faces on the object. As an entity, it can be described by its name and metadata.

THOTH layers are objects which contain the following attributes:

* **Name:** The name of the layer.
* **Description:** The metadata associated with the selection.
* **Selection:** The set of faces to which the metadata is assigned to.
* **Color:** The color the layer selection will be displayed as.
* **Visible:** Defines whether a layer is visible or hidden.

## Layer management

The user can create new layers, as well as modify and delete existing layers. This can be achieved from the layer panel accessed from the Layers button.
