# Opening a scene with THOTH

To open a scene using the THOTH web app, open the following url on your web browser.

```
{base_url}/a/thoth_v2/?s={scene_url}
```

where `base_url` is the base thoth uri and `scene_url` the uri of the scene. The default `base url` is [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

You can create a scene from the ATON front end (shu) or through a post request through the [ATON REST API](../api/rest.md).
